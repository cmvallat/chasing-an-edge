      <h1>Speed Bumps: Why It’s So Hard to Catch Cheaters in Track and Field</h1>
      <h2>A cache of leaked blood tests showed hundreds of track athletes have recorded results “suggestive of doping.” Take a look at why anti-doping tests are so ineffective.</h2>

    <p>Earlier this month, London’s Sunday Times and German broadcaster ARD published a joint investigation
       on doping in track and field that included an analysis of 12,000 leaked blood tests from 5,000 athletes
        between 2001 and 2012. The tests had been carried out by the IAAF, track and field’s international 
        governing body. Two respected experts in doping methods said blood tests of 800 of the athletes were
        “highly suggestive of doping or at the very least abnormal.” Ten runners who won medals in endurance
        events at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London had suspicious test results. And a startling 80 percent
        of Russian medalists recorded tests that showed likely doping. The vast majority of athletes with 
        suspicious tests were never sanctioned.</p>

      <p>On Saturday, the 2015 track and field world championships kick off and, of course, some athletes who 
        are doping will vie for medals. Most will not be caught; only 1 to 2 percent of tests in international 
        Olympic sports result in sanctions each year. If doping is so rife in track and field, why are athletes 
        penalized so rarely? It’s partly because many suspicious tests don’t quite reach the high evidence bar 
        to be considered officially positive. But it’s also because doping athletes tend to employ methods that 
        make drug testing extremely difficult. As Paul Scott, head of Scott Analytics, which provides testing 
        services in multiple sports has put it: “Drug testing has a public reputation that far exceeds its 
        capabilities.”</p>

        <p>Explore below to see why drug tests will never snare every cheater:</p>

            <div class="FAQ">
              <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
              <button class="accordion">What happens if athletes only take a small amount of an illegal substance?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>This is a process called “microdosing,” and a lot of cheating athletes use this method. With most drug tests, such as testosterone, there is a range of acceptable values due to variation in athlete’s natural hormones. The upper limit of this range is usually set at a very high bar so as to avoid false positive tests. Thus, some athletes take just a little bit of illegal substance so as to gain a marginal advantage while still staying within the limits of the test. In races that are determined by hundredths of a second, microdosing can provide a critical advantage while still avoiding detection.</p>
              </div>
              
              <button class="accordion">What if an athlete needs an illegal drug for a legitimate medical condition?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>In this case, an athlete has to get a Therapeutic Use Exemption, or TUE, which are legal “passes” for otherwise illegal medicines or hormones. However, some cheaters try to obtain TUEs by lying about medical conditions. </p>
              </div>

              <button class="accordion">How often do athletes have to be drug tested?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>Testing agencies tell athletes to be available for a test within a scheduled window of a few hours on a certain date; these restrictions are known as “whereabouts requirements.” However, if an athlete misses a test, they can give plausible deniability that they weren’t available due to an “emergency” without punishment, up to three times. So, some cheating athletes can just avoid a test if they know they have drugs in their system and give a random excuse for why they missed a test.</p>
              </div>

              <button class="accordion">What are some tests to see if an athlete is doping?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>Carbon Isotope Ratio (CIR) testing is a way to distinguish between natural and synthetic testosterone, which is a common hormone that athletes use to dope. However, this test is laborious and costly, and usually only used to follow up on a previous suspicious test. Also, CIR testing is not sensitive enough to detect synthetic testosterone at low concentrations, so athletes can still microdose.</p>
                <p>Another method of testing is the Athlete Biological Passport, which detects fluctuations in an individual athlete’s body over time. This establishes a baseline for minimum and maximum hormones for each individual, so the range of “acceptable values” can be limited to an athlete’s historical hormone levels, thereby making microdosers more likely to be caught.</p>
              </div>

              
              <button class="accordion">So what can be done to reduce illegal doping and make the sport fairer?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>Testing athletes repeatedly, outside of competition, and without advanced notice would keep cheating athletes on their toes. Also, testing agencies have started saving testing samples for 10 years to recheck when new, more effective testing methods are developed. That way, one can see if an athlete had been cheating in previous years, but avoided tests due to faults in technology.
                  Additionally, more stringent TUE passes and whereabouts requirements would make it harder for athletes to obtain illegal drugs for medical reasons, and to have to adhere to a stricter testing schedule.
