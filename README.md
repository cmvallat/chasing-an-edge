# Chasing An Edge

I created this website as an assignment for a web development/journalism class (MEJO 187) I took at UNC Chapel Hill. The focus of the assignment was to experiment with front end layouts, specifically CSS grid and/or flexbox. 

We had to create a website based on a piece of investigative journalism. I based mine on ProPublica's investigation of doping and illicit drug use in track and field.

Content is taken from ProPublica, Unsplash and YouTube. None of it is mine. You can find ProPublica's investigation here: https://www.propublica.org/series/chasing-an-edge

Before creating the website, I mocked it up using Adobe XD: https://xd.adobe.com/view/2c90acfe-1c7d-4f2d-a203-478df88c16a5-79c3/
