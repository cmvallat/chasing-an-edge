    <button class="accordion">How do athletes dope and get away with it?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>With most drug tests, such as testosterone, there is a range of acceptable values due to natural variation in athlete’s natural hormones. The upper limit of this range is usually set at a very high bar so as to avoid false positive tests. Thus, a lot of athletes use a process called “microdosing,” where they take just a little bit of illegal substance so as to gain a marginal advantage while still staying within the limits of the test.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Another method is to use Therapeutic Use Exemptions, which are legal “passes” for otherwise illegal medicines or hormones, given to athletes who need those medicines for legitimate medical purposes. However, some cheaters try to obtain TUEs by lying about medical conditions.</p>
      <br>
      <p>One final method is to avoid tests altogether. Testing agencies tell athletes to be available for a test within a scheduled window of a few hours on a certain date. However, if an athlete misses a test, they can give plausible deniability that they weren’t home due to an emergency without punishment up to three times, so some cheating athletes can just avoid a test if they know they have drugs in their system.</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">What some ways we can test to see if an athlete is doping?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Carbon Isotope Ratio (CIR) testing is a way to distinguish between natural and synthetic testosterone, which is a common way that athletes dope. However, this test is laborious and costly, and usually only used to follow up on a previous suspicious test. Also, CIR testing is not sensitive enough to detect synthetic testosterone at low concentrations, so athletes can still microdose.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Another method of testing is the Athlete Biological Passport, which detects changes in an individual athlete’s body over time. This establishes a baseline for min and max hormones, so the range of acceptable values can be limited to an athlete’s historical hormone levels.</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">What are some ways to reduce this illegal doping and make the sport fairer?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Testing athletes repeatedly, outside of competition, and without advanced notice would keep cheating athletes on their toes. Also, saving testing samples for 10 years to recheck when new, more effective testing methods are developed to see if athletes had been cheating in previous years, but avoided tests due to faults in technology.</p>
